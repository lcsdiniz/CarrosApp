# CarrosApp

Mobile app created for study purposes of the Dart language and the Flutter framework. The cars are fetched by an API and saved in the database. The categories are divided into classics, sports and luxury. In addition to these categories, there is a fourth category called "favorites", where all the cars favored by the user are listed.
